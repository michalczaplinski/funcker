Nice to have:

- validate params
- stream response

To do:

- Actually get rid of redis
- Check `docker ps` to get container IDs, ports and route names
- Allow deleting functions
- TESTS

CLI:

- parse the package.json
- require the `main` in package.json
- for now hardcode the url to the "platform"
